This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and attempting to render items that are undefined or null. It typically manifests as a blank screen or a crash, often without providing specific error messages in the console. The root cause is often a mismatch between the data provided to the FlatList and how it's being accessed within the renderItem function.
